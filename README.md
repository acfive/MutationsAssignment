**Mutation Testing Report**

Introduction
Mutation testing is a powerful technique used to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite by introducing artificial defects, known as mutants, into the source code. The primary goal is to assess whether the test suite can detect and kill these mutants, ensuring the robustness of the testing strategy. In this report, we present the results of the mutation testing process conducted on the Poly module.

*Description of Applied Mutations and Their Impact*
The mutation testing process applied a variety of mutations across the Poly module, targeting arithmetic, logical, conditional, and unary operators. Each mutation introduced a subtle change in the code, simulating potential defects that could occur during software development.

*Summary of Mutant Survival and Killing*
The mutation testing process resulted in a total of 128 mutants being generated. The outcomes for these mutants are categorized as follows:

Killed Mutants (üéâ): 30
Timeout Mutants (‚è∞): 0
Suspicious Mutants (ü§î): 1
Survived Mutants (üôÅ): 97
Skipped Mutants (üîá): 0
The test suite demonstrated effectiveness by successfully killing 30 mutants. However, the presence of 97 surviving mutants and one suspicious case indicates potential gaps in test coverage.

*Analysis of the Test Suite's Effectiveness*
The survival of 97 mutants suggests areas where the test suite may lack sufficient coverage. Analyzing the surviving mutants can provide insights into specific scenarios or conditions that are not adequately addressed by the current set of test cases.

*Recommendations for Improving the Test Suite*
Review and Expand Test Cases:

Identify the specific mutants that survived and analyze the corresponding test cases. Expand the test suite to cover these scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive evaluation of the code.
*Optimize Suspicious Test Cases:*

Investigate and optimize test cases that led to suspicious mutants. A long test execution time may indicate inefficiencies that could be addressed to improve the overall testing process.
*Consider Edge Cases:*

Introduce test cases that cover edge and boundary conditions. Ensuring a diverse set of test scenarios enhances the likelihood of detecting subtle defects.
*Conclusion*
Mutation testing provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of a test suite by simulating potential defects in the code. While the current test suite demonstrated success in killing a portion of the mutants, the presence of surviving mutants highlights areas for improvement. By addressing these recommendations, the test suite can be strengthened to provide more comprehensive coverage and enhance the overall reliability of the software.
